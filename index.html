   <p>Hello World! This is my first website. Yay!
   <p> Here is another paragragh of text.

   <h2> A subsection title here </h2>
     <img src = "Princess.jpg" width="30%">
  </a>
   <p> And here is another paragragh.
   Notice that spacing doesn't matter.
   Everthing is printed on one line on the page.
   Even though in the code, these are all seperate lines.
   <p> If you want a new line,you need to use another paragragh tag.
